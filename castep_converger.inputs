# this is because it is wise to always set at least the	    #
# seed as default is Si.				    #
# By default the file should be 'castep_converger.inputs'   #
# but this can be changed in the script if required.	    #
#############################################################

#############################################################
# This file contains all the possible inputs that can be    #

#############################################################
# ALL INPUTS ARE GIVEN AS KEY = VALUE PAIRS,		    #
# KEYS MUST BE SEPERATED BY AN '=' SYMBOL FROM THEIR VALUES #
# AFTER THE '=' ONLY A VALUE SHOULD BE GIVEN, NO COMMENTS   #
